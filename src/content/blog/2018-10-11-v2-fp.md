In this post, I tell about one of the most exciting features in v2: functional programming submodule. It provides alternative to code chains and enables currying. FP fans will love this!

> date-fns v2 introduces many new features and breaking changes and this post is a part of a series where we describe in detail most notable ones.

## Currying by default

FP submodule introduces copies of regular functions which accept **arguments in inverse order** and curryied by default. They could be imported from date-fns/fp and used along with regular functions.

```js
const { differenceInDays: regularDifferenceInDays } = require("date-fns");
const { differenceInDays: fpDifferenceInDays } = require("date-fns/fp");

regularDifferenceInDays(Date.now(), 0);
//=> 17815

fpDifferenceInDays(0, Date.now());
//=> 17815

fpDifferenceInDays(0)(Date.now());
//=> 17815

const daysSinceUnixEpoch = fpDifferenceInDays(0);
daysSinceUnixEpoch(Date.now());
//=> 17815
```

We also refined the order of arguments in the regular functions so they would work well with currying.

## Usage with options

Each FP function comes in two variations:

1. One that accepts options as the first argument. Such functions has WithOptions added to the end of its name.

2. Another that doesn't have the options argument.

```js
const { format, formatWithOptions } = require("date-fns/fp");
const { eo, ru } = require("date-fns/locale");

const dateFormat = "LLLL yyyy";

const english = format(dateFormat);
const russian = formatWithOptions({ locale: ru }, dateFormat);
const esperanto = formatWithOptions({ locale: eo }, dateFormat);

english(Date.now());
//=> 'October 2018'

russian(Date.now());
//=> 'октябрь 2018'

esperanto(Date.now());
//=> 'oktobro 2018'
```

## Lodash compatibility

FP submodule was inspired by Lodash and fully compatible with it. You can use its helpers to compose date-fns functions:

```js
const { flow } = require("lodash/fp");
const { setDate, addDays, addMonths, format } = require("date-fns/fp");

const idealDate = format("yyyy-MM-dd");
const firstDayNextMonth = flow(addMonths(1), setDate(1));
const nearestSunday = (date) =>
  date.getDay() && addDays(7 - date.getDay(), date);
const nextMonthSunday = flow(firstDayNextMonth, nearestSunday, idealDate);

nextMonthSunday(Date.now());
//=> '2018-11-04'
```

## Price of pureness

While we were working on the FP submodule we realized that functions which create an internal state (e.g. \`isToday\`) couldn't be safely curried and might cause bugs as in the given example:

```js
import { distanceInWordsToNowWithOptions } from "date-fns/fp";
const distanceInWordsToNow = distanceInWordsToNowWithOptions({
  addSuffix: true,
});

// Days later you'll get an expected behavior:
const result = distanceInWordsToNow(Date.now());
```

[So we've removed all functions that involve creating a date](https://github.com/date-fns/date-fns/issues/377), and it made date-fns 100% pure library.
